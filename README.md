## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown 
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt more than any online tutorial taught me. I learnt 
- how to make a custom animation and a custom loading page
- how to use async with arrow functions
- use fetch more comfortably
- debug better and accurately

This in general was an amazing hackathon. I can't thank Frontend Mentor enough for this opportunity and a great addition to my portfolio.

### Continued development

I made the site completely with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS and in the future i want to be able to create a site like that with TypeScript.
